# 🚀 CodeCrackles

**CodeCrackles** is a front-end–focused MVP project built to practice and showcase modern web development fundamentals — authentication flow, user profiles, dashboards, and interactive quizzes — using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

This project is part of my continuous learning journey and portfolio.

## 🔐 Security Note (MVP Scope)

All user data is stored in **browser localStorage** for simplicity.

This approach is:

- ✅ Suitable for demos and learning
- ❌ Not secure for production use

Users are advised to:

- Use **dummy emails and passwords**
- Treat the project as an **idea / MVP / demo**

Future versions will introduce backend authentication and secure storage.
